       User Centered Design
      </h1>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        User-centred design (UCD) or user-driven development is a framework in which the user’s needs, objectives and feedback are considered at each stage of the project, in order to make more usable and accessible services and solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        By adopting this approach, you will reduce the risk to your project by building the right solution first time that has been validated with your users. This will reduce your initial development time and costs, and eliminate any potentially expensive redevelopments. Building a more usable product will also mean customers will achieve their goals more easily meaning you, the business, will achieve your goals more easily. All of this builds trust between you and your users, which will ultimately result in better uptake of your service.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/images/UCD.gif" alt=" The User Centered Design process">
          <p class="govuk-body">
            Here are some key elements of UCD that if incorporated into you development process will make your service more user friendly and elicit the benefits outlined above.
              </p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">User Research</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                It seems obvious to say, but in order to make a more usable service; you need to know about your users.   
                </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
             <li>Who they are</li>
             <li>What they do</li>
             <li>How they use the internet</li>
             <li>What problems they might face</li>
             <li>What are their goals and motivations</li>
            </ul>    
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Without this knowledge, you will not know the problems you are trying to solve and may end up building a service that people cannot or will not use.   
                </p>      
            <p class="govuk-body">
                To learn more about User Research specifically for government services, the GOV.UK Service Manual does a great overview.   
            </p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Prototyping</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                A Prototype is a non-functional representation of what your service or a part of it will look like based on your team’s current thinking or ideas. It can be as simple as a sketch on a piece of paper to a more high-fidelity fully interactive HTML prototype.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/images/prototypelofi.gif" alt="Hand drawn 'lo-fi' prototype for a mobile application">
                <p class="govuk-body"> The main aim of the prototype is to put your design in front of the team and users in order to get feedback and identify potential pain points. This feedback and issues can then help refine your design, before a lot of time and effort is put into development.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body"> Repeating the process throughout your development lifecycle will make your overall end service more usable. Don’t stop there, you can use prototypes to explore new improvements to a live service.</p>
                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Usability testing</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body"> There are various types of testing that are carried out during the development of an online service: smoke testing, business acceptance testing, user acceptance testing, and performance testing. They all fulfil a purpose, but are mainly geared towards ensuring that the service functionally does what it is supposed to and that it does not break or fall over. However, what about usability? This is often overlooked or not recognised as a priority, but it is essential if you want to know that what you have built was worth all the effort and is actually fit for purpose.</p>
